Tools – list three tools (MUMBL 🎙️, WRITER ✍️, MUSE 🧠) that open special creative interfaces. 2. Projects – collapsible section, includes “+ New Project” and 3–4 saved projects. 3. Songs – dynamic list similar to chat history, with a “+ New Song” button at the top.  Design should use a dark mode aesthetic, SF Pro or similar font, soft shadows, clean spacing, and minimalist icons. Structure and feel should closely mimic the ChatGPT mobile app's sidebar.   ⸻ redesign your sidebar in the style of ChatGPT, but tailored to your music creation flow.  ⸻  ✅ Mimic Sidebar Layout (Apple/ChatGPT Style)  🧱 STRUCTURE  ───────────────────────────── 🔍 Search  🛠️ Tools • MUMBL  • WRITER  • MUSE   📁 Projects • + New Project • MUSE 2.0 • PROMPT MASTER • BAES STUFF • 10 more ⌄  🎵 Songs • “+ New Song” • Lost in Tokyo • Untitled Beat • Midnight Loops  ───────────────────────────── 👤 ayo omoloja   ⸻  ✨ DESIGN NOTES  🔍 Search 	•	Keep same position and styling — rounded field, subtle shadow. 	•	Use to filter songs, tools, and projects.  🛠 Tools Section  Like GPTs but renamed.

Include a visible “Edit” button at the bottom right of the screen that: 	•	Returns the user to the standard card view lyric editor, where they can continue writing and revising.
