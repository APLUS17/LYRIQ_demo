Tools – list three tools (MUMBL 🎙️, WRITER ✍️, MUSE 🧠) that open special creative interfaces. 2. Projects – collapsible section, includes “+ New Project” and 3–4 saved projects. 3. Songs – dynamic list similar to chat history, with a “+ New Song” button at the top.  Design should use a dark mode aesthetic, SF Pro or similar font, soft shadows, clean spacing, and minimalist icons. Structure and feel should closely mimic the ChatGPT mobile app's sidebar.   ⸻ redesign your sidebar in the style of ChatGPT, but tailored to your music creation flow.  ⸻  ✅ Mimic Sidebar Layout (Apple/ChatGPT Style)  🧱 STRUCTURE  ───────────────────────────── 🔍 Search  🛠️ Tools • MUMBL  • WRITER  • MUSE   📁 Projects • + New Project • MUSE 2.0 • PROMPT MASTER • BAES STUFF • 10 more ⌄  🎵 Songs • “+ New Song” • Lost in Tokyo • Untitled Beat • Midnight Loops  ───────────────────────────── 👤 ayo omoloja   ⸻  ✨ DESIGN NOTES  🔍 Search 	•	Keep same position and styling — rounded field, subtle shadow. 	•	Use to filter songs, tools, and projects.  🛠 Tools Section  Like GPTs but renamed. Each tool can: 	•	Open a new workspace or floating tool pane. 	•	Be assigned a distinct icon: 	•	MUMBL = 🎙️ (Auto-humming / melody gen) 	•	WRITER = ✍️ (Lyrics editor/assistant) 	•	MUSE = 🧠 (File/project organizer)  📁 Projects 	•	Use collapsible folders like “My GPTs.” 	•	“+ New Project” stays on top. 	•	Each item acts like a project board (multi-song container).  🎵 Songs 	•	Individual sessions like chat threads. 	•	“+ New Song” starts a new writing session. 	•	Title, small preview, or last opened timestamp (if needed).  ⸻  It should look almost identical to the screenshots structure , with a smooth slide in animation    "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/3EDDD546-9D88-46E5-94E6-BCC7887BBF4A.jpg\n\n[2025-07-22T16:19:49.755Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: " And redo the home page to look like this   "\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/B2E0AA1E-042B-4D85-B7A5-8C7FC28197EE.jpg\n\n[2025-07-22T16:42:45.470Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "When you click create song section , this modal should pop up before opening the Lyric pad"\nImage URI: https://images.composerapi.com/45B97306-C540-4311-BE6A-A1EDD5CEB2BB.jpg\n\n[2025-07-23T14:06:58.353Z] System note: Image provided by user\nPrompt: "Instead of the home, make a small hamburger menu that opens a sidebar on the left .
